# **App Name**: Supply Chain Sentinel

## Core Features:

- Data Ingestion and Processing: Ingest real-time data from various sources (weather, traffic, port congestion, infrastructure) to create a comprehensive supply chain view.
- Predictive Disruption Forecasting: Employ AI to forecast supply chain disruptions 12-48 hours in advance based on ingested data. This feature uses reasoning to determine the likelihood and potential impact of disruptions, and acts as a tool that enables users to simulate and prepare for these.
- Optimal Rerouting Calculation: Automatically calculate optimal, multi-modal rerouting strategies for freight based on predicted disruptions and predefined constraints (cost, time, sustainability).
- National Dashboard Visualization: Visualize major freight corridors on a national dashboard, highlighting at-risk shipments and alternative routes.
- Simulated Disruption Trigger: Allow users to trigger simulated disruptions (e.g., hurricanes, port closures) to test the system's response and explore alternative routes.
- Savings Calculation Display: Display calculated savings in time, cost, and CO2 emissions for alternative routes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Google Blue (#4285F4) to align with Google's brand and evoke trust and reliability. This hue aligns well with the tech-focused theme of the application, without being a cliche.
- Background color: Light gray (#F1F3F4) for a clean, professional look, providing sufficient contrast for the primary color in a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Google Yellow (#FBBC04) for highlighting critical alerts and CTAs, creating high contrast to draw attention. This hue is analogous to Google Blue.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral, and easily readable interface.
- Use clear, intuitive icons to represent different types of data and actions.
- Implement a clean, dashboard-style layout for efficient information presentation.
- Use subtle animations for data updates and route changes to enhance user engagement.
